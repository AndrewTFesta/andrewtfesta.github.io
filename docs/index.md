A place all for me to just ramble and rant. And you've come across this place. How unfortunate of you.

<!--

I am a Machine Learning Engineer and Researcher with a passion for solving problems and building innovative solutions. My commitment to my work is strongest when I am engaged in projects that involve creating and realizing impactful ideas. Reflecting on my experiences, especially those at IOMAXIS, I find the most fulfillment in developing full-scale products and solutions rather than smaller, less integrated tasks.

In the near future, I am seeking opportunities that allow me to expand my skill set in both the engineering processes and the holistic development of products or ideas. My goal is to contribute to and learn from projects that have the potential to grow into something significant and lasting. I aspire to build and be proud of something that extends beyond small-scale initiatives, grounded in a vision for the future.

If you have grand ideas, let me be the developer that helps you bring them into the tangible, lasting solutions. I am eager to engage in opportunities that allow for me to contribute and scale challenging, meaningful projects.

I've been thinking further on our conversation from the other day and talking it through with some of my labmates from before. Gaurav pointed out that I'm most devoted when I'm solving a problem, and more importantly, building *something*.I think that's the direction I want to move at least in the immediate future, especially concerning cultivating relevant skillsets. Part of this is the (software) engineering processes, but also a full product/company/idea. Even thinking back to our time at IOMAXIS, the small contracts we started to tackle towards the end were less fulfilling and evoed less commitment. But when we were working on our projects that we wanted to make something out of, those were the type of projects I wanted to pursue; how to turn a grand idea into a realized implementation. 

Towards that end, I think for the next while, I want to find something that either guides me, or allows me to learn, what it takes to build something that is mine and that I am proud of, beyond just small scale projects or one-offs. Even while with Dr. Tumer, the papers and projects I'd pitch would always be backed by a larger idea of where I wanted to go with it the eventual future (though scoping wasn't always consistent and not always part of the pitch).

I am an experienced Machine Learning Engineer and Researcher with a strong background in AI, multi-agent systems, and cybersecurity. My work has spanned developing high-accuracy recognition systems, enhancing proposal processes through advanced machine learning, and conducting research on innovative audio separation techniques.


I am passionate about leveraging my skills to drive technological advancements and contribute to cutting-edge AI research and applications. I am currently seeking opportunities that allow me to work on impactful projects, collaborate with interdisciplinary teams, and continue my professional growth in the fields of machine learning and AI.
